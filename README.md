# Classification to Predict Mobile Phone Prices
A Machine Learning Project to predict the Price Class of a Mobile based on its Specifications

#### We studied the entire dataset we had for the topic on Kaggle, we were going to work on 

- The Data Preprocessing
  - Description of Data 
  - Info about the data
  - The Correlation between the attributes
  - The attributes that are most correlated with the Price Range ( Our target )
  - Outlier Analysis of Non-categorical Data
  - Histogram of all the attributes
  
#### Next we tried a total of 3 Machine Learning Algorithms for each we made a confusion matrix and the most contributing features were found

1. Random Forest (RF)
2. Support vector Machine (SVM)
3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

#### We compared the accuracies of all the models and found that ANN is the best classifier for our project
#### Using the test data we then used our model to predict values for the unseen data 
#### Finally Made a classification report for our ANN Model
